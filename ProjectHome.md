Each repository stores code for one robot configuration or project - the `BunnyBot` platform, the mecanum-drive testbench, etc.  If you start a new project (perhaps based on one of the FRC example projects), create a new repository and commit _before_ you start making changes to the code!

Repositories for the 2013 post-season:

  * [bunny2013](bunny2013.md) - code for the 2013 Bunny Bot competition.
  * [wpilib](wpilib.md) - modified WPILib with bugfixes and portability enhancements.
  * [holo3](holo3.md) - competition robot (Gary) code, based on a 3-wheel holonomic drive platform
  * [porting](porting.md) - porting the robot code and WPILib to other hardware and operating systems
  * [stats](stats.md) - a program for collecting and analyzing team statistics

Active repositories as of the end of the 2012 competition season include:

  * [drivervision](drivervision.md) - our automatic-targeting application that runs on the driver station PC and provides steering directions to the robot
  * [balance](balance.md) - final code for the 2012 competition
  * [testing2012](testing2012.md) - alternative code for the 2012 competition
